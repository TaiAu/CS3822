A Sudoku Solver Program - by Tai

To run the Sudoku Solver Program, run the main method in the "Run.java" class in the controller package.

To create a puzzle, a user may:

1. Manually input a valid Sudoku puzzle by clicking on the Sudoku cells and typing in corresponding values for the cell.
2. Loading a saved puzzle by clicking on the "Load Puzzle" button
OR
3. Click on one of the Puzzle generator buttons "Easy Random Puzzle", "Medium Random Puzzle", "Hard Random Puzzle", "Fiendish Puzzle" or "Symmetrical Puzzle"

A user may show or hide hints by pressing on the "Show Hints" and "Hide Hints" buttons respectively.

A user may solve the Sudoku puzzle by pressing on the "Solve Puzzle" button (a valid Sudoku should be entered because some puzzles do not only have one solution, but this is not required in all cases as there is an additional guessing algorithm to continue the search).

A user may clear the Sudoku grid by pressing on the "Clear Grid" button.

A user may save and load puzzles by pressing on the "Save Puzzle" and "Load Puzzle" buttons respectively.

A user may lock the Sudoku grid by pressing on the "Lock Grid" button.
